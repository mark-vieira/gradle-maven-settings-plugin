# Gradle Maven settings plugin

This Gradle plugin provides a migration path for projects coming from a Maven ecosystem. It exposes standard Maven
configuration located in [settings files](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html) to your Gradle project. This allows 
projects to continue to leverage functionality provided by Maven such as mirrors as well use existing
settings configuration to store encrypted repository authentication credentials.

## Usage
This plugin is hosted on the [Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/net.linguica.maven-settings).
To use the plugin, add the following to your `build.gradle` file.
    
    plugins {
      id 'net.linguica.maven-settings' version '0.6'
    }
    
For Gradle 2.0 or earlier you must add the following:
    
    buildscript {
        repositories {
            maven {
                url 'https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/'
            }
        }
        
        dependencies {
            classpath 'net.linguica.gradle:maven-settings-plugin:0.6'
        }
    }

    apply plugin: 'net.linguica.maven-settings'

## Mirrors
The plugin exposes Maven-like mirror capabilities. The plugin will properly register and enforce any 
mirrors defined in a `settings.xml` with `<mirrorOf>` values of `*`, `external:*` or `central`. Existing 
`repositories {...}` definitions that match these identifiers will be removed. 

Exclusions are also taken into consideration. For example, a `<mirrorOf>` value of `*,!myRepo` will replace
all repositories except for the repository with the name 'myRepo'.

## Credentials
The plugin will attempt to apply credentials located in `<server>` elements to appropriate Maven repository 
definitions in your build script. This is done by matching the `<id>` element in the `settings.xml` file to the `name`
property of the repository definition.

    repositories {
        maven {
            name = 'myRepo' // should match <id>myRepo</id> of appropriate <server> in settings.xml
            url = 'https://intranet.foo.org/repo'
        }
    }

Server credentials are used for mirrors as well. When mirrors are added the plugin will look for a `<server>` element 
with the same `<id>` and the configured credentials are used and [decrypted](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-encryption.html) 
if necessary.

### Publishing
The plugin will also attempt to apply credentials to repositories configured using the 
['maven-publish'](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html) plugin.

    publishing {
        repositories {
            maven {
                name = 'myRepo' // should match <id>myRepo</id> of appropriate <server> in settings.xml
                url = 'https://intranet.foo.org/repo/repositories/releases'
            }
        }
    }
    

### Supported Types
The plugin currently supports Basic Authentication credentials and Http Header Authentication. If both are provided for a server
the basic authentication credentials are preferred.

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>myRepo</id>
      <!--basic authentication-->
      <username>username</username>
      <password>encrypted-secret</password>
      <!--http header authentication-->
      <configuration>
        <httpHeaders>
          <property>
            <name>Some-Auth-Token</name>
            <value>secret</value>
          </property>
        </httpHeaders>
      </configuration>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

## Profiles
Profiles defined in a `settings.xml` will have their properties exported to the Gradle project when the profile is considered
active. Active profiles are those listed in the `<activeProfiles>` section of the `settings.xml`, the `activeProfiles`
property of the `mavenSettings {...}` configuration closure, or those that satisfy the given profile's `<activation>`
criteria.

## Configuration
Configuration of the Maven settings plugin is done via the `mavenSettings {...}` configuration closure. The following 
properties are available.

* `userSettingsFileName` - String representing the path of the file to be used as the user settings file. This defaults to 
`'$USER_HOME/.m2/settings.xml'`
* `activeProfiles` - List of profile ids to treat as active.
* `exportGradleProps` - Flag indicating whether or not Gradle project properties should be exported for the purposes of 
settings file property interpolation and profile activation. This defaults to `true`.
